# Predict Crime Type

## Project Overview
The Predict Crime Type project focuses on analyzing crime data to predict the type of crime based on various features. This project involves data cleaning, correlation analysis, and applying multiple machine learning models to achieve the best prediction accuracy.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized the data distribution and identified patterns and anomalies.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- **Feature Correlation:** Analyzed the relationships between different features to identify significant correlations.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Baseline Model:** Established a baseline accuracy using simple models.
- **Advanced Models:** Applied several machine learning algorithms:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Perceptron**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Model Optimization:** Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

## Results
The project compares the performance of different models in terms of accuracy. The best model is selected based on the highest accuracy achieved through GridSearchCV.
